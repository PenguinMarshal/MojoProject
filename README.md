# MojoProject
Capstone Mojo Project

Summary:
This is a simple custom sorting algorithm(visualizer) project primarily done in Mojo. 

Description:
Users will be able to input various array sizes and select through a number of sorting algorithms(bubble, quicksort, etc.) and possibly custom sorting algorithms as well. The program will aim to illustrate the result and ultimately the differences while giving some feedback such as effectivness(time) and such.
